# Rubisco
A modern scripting utility interface for Roblox.

# About
Rubisco provides the interface for APIs that run scripts within Roblox. This project stayed private as I was largely doing it to learn more Flutter. While I made this to security test my own Roblox games, malicious actors could have used this for the wrong reasons. This was never released, and I am only releasing it now as it can no longer function as a cheating utility.

# Features
- Cross Platform
- Syntax highlighting using Monaco
- Tab integration for programming space
- Online script search
- Automatic updates (via external loader)
- Key system integration via webview for monetization
- HWID-based cryptographic key generation
